At this point of processing, we don't know yet whether the data is going to be interpreted an binary or not. (In fact, we may never find out because HTTP/0.9 lacks the Content-Type headers; only by configuring mod_charset_lite can we control the conversion). But mod_charset_lite will get control only later, so it cannot decide on the conversion of the current buffer full of data. => This is an extreme and rare situation normally. So, for catching the most obvious problem (talking not to a HTTP server but to some other protocol), the best guess here is to treat the buffer as "text/*" (to make error messages readable)."

The basic design has ap_setup_client_block setting a field in the conn_rec which tells http_filter how much data is in the body (with chunking this will represent how much data is in the chunk).  The ap_get_client_block then calls down the stack with the maximum amount of data that it can receive back.  When http_filter reads all of the data, it adds an eos bucket to the end of the brigade.  ap_get_client_block continues to read data until it gets the eos bucket.
