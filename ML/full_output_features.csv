Concurrent fixes are being applied to the server to ensure that it rejects queries that may have been corrupted by attempted SQL injection, but this merely guarantees that unpatched clients will fail rather than allow injection.

The tighter check is needed to defend against SQL-injection attacks as per CVE-2006-2313 (further details will be published after release).  Embedded zero (null) bytes will be rejected as well.  The checks are applied during input to the backend (receipt from client or COPY IN), so it no longer seems necessary to check in textin() and related routines; any string arriving at those functions will already have been validated.

The basic design has ap_setup_client_block setting a field in the conn_rec which tells http_filter how much data is in the body (with chunking this will represent how much data is in the chunk).  The ap_get_client_block then calls down the stack with the maximum amount of data that it can receive back.  When http_filter reads all of the data, it adds an eos bucket to the end of the brigade.  ap_get_client_block continues to read data until it gets the eos bucket.  This allows filters to increase the size of the body data.","2","62","22"

This is correct for buckets, but it means that when we get data out of the buckets, we may have to split the bucket to make sure that any copy operations are safe.  We were originally doing the split at the number of characters read from the bucket, but we really want to do it at the length of the buffer.","1","10","6"

Although the original fix apparently helped for www.openacs.org, it appears to simply change the timing, but did not fix the problem itself. The problem was that under limited resource configurations (e.g. maxthreads 5, maxconnections 3) and heavy traffic, incoming requests were queued but not processed in new connection threads. The situation was especially bad, when the number of queued requests was larger than maxconnections, since after processing n requests the server was idling with a high number of queued requests. New requests were put to the end of the queue while old (maybe already timed-out) requests are being served. The server appeared to hang.","2","35","15"

Although the original fix apparently helped for www.openacs.org, it appears to simply change the timing, but did not fix the problem itself. The problem was that under limited resource configurations (e.g. maxthreads 5, maxconnections 3) and heavy traffic, incoming requests were queued but not processed in new connection threads. The situation was especially bad, when the number of queued requests was larger than maxconnections, since after processing n requests the server was idling with a high number of queued requests. New requests were put to the end of the queue while old (maybe already timed-out) requests are being served. The server appeared to hang.","2","35","15"

Since the opening takes one or two frames, it leaves a few milliseconds in which code which relies on that open/closed state erroneously assumes that it can use elements that should be on stage or initialized. In this case it's the layout property, which, due to the skin of the DropDownList, is only initialized once the drop down is actually open.","3","8","17"

This second step was skipped in the previous commit. This could be noticed, for example, in DataGrid, which would not show the renderers which it initially used in GridViewLayout.updateTypicalCellSizes().

However, the function it called for the nodes with children, getChildren() unfortunately had a necessary side-effect (which is a poor design choice, to be sure), which was to add an event listener to the children collection. So the empty collections of nodes were not listened to, which meant that once the node was open any children that were added to that node were not counted towards the length of the collection. And one way this inconsistency surfaced was through the expandItem() fatal.","2","4","5"

(If you want to see that series of stack traces, open stack.xml on the Jira ticket.) When this happens, either ConstraintLayout.measure() or ConstraintLayout.updateDisplayList() ends up calling clearConstraintCache(). (This is expected behaviour when there's no convoluted stack trace which ends up re-validating the same component, as we have here.) Now, when this inner validation cycle ends, and the outer call to parseConstraints() continues execution, it does so with all the cache variables nulled. This can result in a fatal if there is still a layout element remaining in parseConstraints() to parse via parseElementConstraints(). The latter function needs the cache Vector rowBaselines""","1","18","8"

Now the solution is that, for WAR in EAR, as the WAR will be extracted, we will add the module directory prefix for those files, so that bundle.getEntry could work. for EJB in EAR, the url will be something like ejb.jar!/META-INF/a.wsdl, we will try to build a jar URL to get the resource, one thing that needs to improve is that, this kind of URL will cause a full copy of the target jar file, as JarURLHandler may not recognize the bundleentry protocol.","12","151","59"
