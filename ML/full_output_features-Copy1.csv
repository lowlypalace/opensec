Concurrent fixes are being applied to the server to ensure that it rejects queries that may have been corrupted by attempted SQL injection, but this merely guarantees that unpatched clients will fail rather than allow injection.

The tighter check is needed to defend against SQL-injection attacks as per CVE-2006-2313 (further details will be published after release).  Embedded zero (null) bytes will be rejected as well.  The checks are applied during input to the backend (receipt from client or COPY IN), so it no longer seems necessary to check in textin() and related routines; any string arriving at those functions will already have been validated.

The basic design has ap_setup_client_block setting a field in the conn_rec which tells http_filter how much data is in the body (with chunking this will represent how much data is in the chunk).  The ap_get_client_block then calls down the stack with the maximum amount of data that it can receive back.  When http_filter reads all of the data, it adds an eos bucket to the end of the brigade.  ap_get_client_block continues to read data until it gets the eos bucket.  This allows filters to increase the size of the body data.","2","62","22"

This is correct for buckets, but it means that when we get data out of the buckets, we may have to split the bucket to make sure that any copy operations are safe.  We were originally doing the split at the number of characters read from the bucket, but we really want to do it at the length of the buffer.","1","10","6"
